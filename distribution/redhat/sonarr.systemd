# SCHED_OTHER is the default Linux time-sharing scheduler that is intended for
# all threads that do not require the special real-time mechanisms.
# see [man 7 sched]
#CPUSchedulingPolicy=other
# The default scheduling priority is 10.
# see [man 1 getpriority]
# see [man 1 nice]
Nice=15

# The best-effort scheduling class is the default for any process that hasn't
# set a specific I/O priority. Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7
# (lowest).
# see [man 2 ioprio_set]
#IOSchedulingClass=best-effort
# The priority within the best-effort class will be dynamically derived from
# the CPU nice level of the process: io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.
# see [man 1 ionice]
#IOSchedulingPriority=7
